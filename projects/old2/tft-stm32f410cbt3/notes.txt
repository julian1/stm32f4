Using anti-grain to rasterize text - will use a lot less memory than highresolution bitmaps for fonts.
  eg. do not even have enough memory to cover screen.
  bitmap fonts - would probably want to be stored sram rather than flash spi also. for speed.

  also. a vectorized font will use less memory for storage - may not need flash spi.
  just bake it in as a static C code.

STM32F429I-DISCO board is equipped with 8MB SDRAM chip (IS42S16400J from
Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc.). This SDRAM memory chip is connected to
SDRAM bank 2 of Flexible Memory Controller of STM32F429 MCU. SDRAM memory can
be used as frame buffer for big LCDs (up to 800x600). 

 // Clear SDRAM or fill with some pattern/color
  for(tmp = SDRAM_BASE; tmp < (SDRAM_BASE + SDRAM_SIZE); tmp += 4)
    *((uint32_t *)tmp) = 0x00000000;
